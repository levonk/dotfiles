# Feature Matrix Guidelines

When creating feature matrices for comparing different options:

## Structure Requirements

- Items being compared should be at the top
- Link inline to the items that are being compared
- Be detailed and extensive with the features and their implementations
- Use iconography to help quickly compare behavior including the candidates being checked based on intelligently weighted scores:
  - ⭐ (best)
  - ☑️ (good)
  - ⚠️ (bad)
  - ❌ (worst)
- Don't shove a ton of features into the notes field so it makes it hard to compare. Make them features.

## Required Features

The following features must always be included in any comparison:

- ⭐ FOSS, ☑️ OSS, ⚠️ Free, ❌ Paid
- UX/UI (CLI equivalent for config/cmd line args)
- Setup Difficulty
- Community
- Year Introduced
- Run Modes:
  - paid remote service
  - free remote service
  - reduced local service
  - full featured local service
  - client run graphical
  - client run CLI
- Linux Support (Debian)
- Windows Support
- Darwin Support
- Notes

## Additional Guidelines

- Feel free to add footnotes in the feature implementation details to make the comparison readable, but still provide details of the specific implementation below
- Provide recommendations based on Persona at the end
