# MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) Discovery and Configuration Tool for Linux/WSL
#
# WHAT IS MTU?
# MTU is the largest packet size that can be transmitted over a network interface
# without fragmentation. Standard Ethernet MTU is 1500 bytes, but VPNs, tunnels,
# and some network configurations require smaller MTUs.
#
# PROBLEMS WITH MTU MISMATCH:
# - Slow or stalled connections (packets get dropped/fragmented)
# - Timeouts when accessing websites or services
# - SSH/RDP sessions that connect but hang during data transfer
# - Large file transfers that fail or are extremely slow
# - Applications that work on small data but fail on larger payloads
#
# HOW THIS SCRIPT HELPS:
# 1. Shows current interface MTU settings
# 2. Uses binary search to find the maximum working path MTU
# 3. Tests actual network connectivity to find optimal MTU
# 4. Provides commands to set the discovered MTU permanently
#
# USAGE:
#   ./DebugLinuxNetworkMTU.bash [max] [min]
#   Default: max=1500, min=900
#   Example: ./DebugLinuxNetworkMTU.bash 1400 1000
#

# Parse command line arguments with defaults
max=${1:-1500}
min=${2:-900}
