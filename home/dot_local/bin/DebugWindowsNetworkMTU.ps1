.SYNOPSIS
    MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) Discovery and Configuration Tool for Windows

.DESCRIPTION
    WHAT IS MTU?
    MTU is the largest packet size that can be transmitted over a network interface
    without fragmentation. Standard Ethernet MTU is 1500 bytes, but VPNs, tunnels,
    and some network configurations require smaller MTUs.

    PROBLEMS WITH MTU MISMATCH:
    - Slow or stalled connections (packets get dropped/fragmented)
    - Timeouts when accessing websites or services
    - RDP/SSH sessions that connect but hang during data transfer
    - Large file transfers that fail or are extremely slow
    - Applications that work on small data but fail on larger payloads

    HOW THIS SCRIPT HELPS:
    1. Shows current interface MTU settings
    2. Demonstrates binary search algorithm for MTU discovery
    3. Provides Windows-specific ping commands for MTU testing
    4. Offers guidance on setting MTU permanently

.PARAMETER max
    Maximum MTU to test (default: 1500)

.PARAMETER min
    Minimum MTU to test (default: 900)

.EXAMPLE
    .\DebugWindowsNetworkMTU.ps1
    Run with default parameters (max=1500, min=900)

.EXAMPLE
    .\DebugWindowsNetworkMTU.ps1 -max 1400 -min 1000
    Run with custom MTU range
