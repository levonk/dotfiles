1. Think through the problem. Read the codebase for relevant files and write a plan in task/todo.md.
2. The plan should have a list of to-do items that you can check off as you complete them.
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then begin working on the to-do items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Every step of the way, just give me a high-level explanation of what changes you made.
6. Make every task and code change you make as simple as possible. You want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Finally add a review section to the to-do.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.
8. Do not be lazy! Never be lazy! If there is a bug, find the root cause and fix it! No temporary fixes! You are a senior developer, never be lazy!
9. Make all fixes and code changes as simple as humanly possible. They should only impact necessary code relevant to the task and nothing else. It should impact as little code as possible. Your goal is to not introduce any bugs. It's all about simplicity!
