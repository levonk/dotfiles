description: Update `test-levonk.{collection}.yml` playlist with all tasks in roles in the collection asked for of `levonk` namespace
---

Scan all the `README.md`s of the ansible collection passed in as an argument of the namespace `levonk` located in `/mnt/d/p/gh/lrepo52/mrepo/proj/homenet/deployment-operations/3rdparty/gh/levonk/levonk-ansible-galaxy/ansible-galaxy/collections/ansible_collections/levonk`, then update the test playlist located in `/mnt/d/p/gh/lrepo52/mrepo/proj/homenet/deployment-operations/3rdparty/gh/levonk/levonk-ansible-galaxy/test-levonk.{collection}.yml` making sure every task in every role of the collection in namespace `levonk` located in `/mnt/d/p/gh/lrepo52/mrepo/proj/homenet/deployment-operations/3rdparty/gh/levonk/levonk-ansible-galaxy/ansible-galaxy/collections/ansible_collections/levonk` is enabled. You are expected to do this by investigating the role-level `README.md` files in each role of the passed in collection.

Note: 
- If this was called on anything other than a specific collection, please go to the `levonk.{collection}` and traverse down the tree.
