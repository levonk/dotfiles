## Overview

Generates a professional 10-slide pitch deck following proven sales frameworks (SPIN, Value Selling, Challenger Sale). Transforms raw input into a compelling narrative that addresses pain points, demonstrates value, and drives decision-making.

## Inputs

- **source_material**: Proposal document, discovery call transcript, or meeting notes
- **company_name**: Target company name (extracted from source if not provided)
- **solution_name**: Product/service being pitched (extracted from source if not provided)
- **deck_format**: Output format (markdown, JSON, or outline) - default: markdown

## Output Structure

Standard 10-slide deck optimized for B2B sales:

1. **Hook/Opening** - Attention-grabbing statement
2. **Problem Definition** - Pain points and current state
3. **Market Context** - Industry trends and urgency
4. **Solution Introduction** - High-level overview
5. **How It Works** - Key features and approach
6. **Value Proposition** - Quantified benefits and ROI
7. **Proof Points** - Case studies, metrics, testimonials
8. **Competitive Differentiation** - Why this solution wins
9. **Implementation Path** - Timeline and next steps
10. **Call to Action** - Clear ask and close

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Extract Core Intelligence

Analyze the source material to identify:

- **Pain points**: Current challenges, frustrations, costs of inaction
- **Stakeholders**: Decision-makers, influencers, champions, budget holders
- **Goals**: Business objectives, success metrics, timeline constraints
- **Context**: Industry, company size, competitive landscape, existing solutions
- **Opportunities**: Gaps in current approach, unrealized potential, strategic initiatives

**Extraction prompt**:
```
Analyze this [proposal/transcript] and extract:
1. Top 3 pain points with business impact
2. Key stakeholders and their priorities
3. Stated goals and success criteria
4. Current state and limitations
5. Budget signals and timeline urgency
6. Decision criteria mentioned
7. Competitive alternatives discussed
8. Objections or concerns raised

Source material:
[PASTE SOURCE_MATERIAL]
```

### Step 2: Build Narrative Arc

Construct the story flow:

- **Act 1** (Slides 1-3): Establish credibility, define the problem, create urgency
- **Act 2** (Slides 4-7): Present solution, demonstrate value, prove capability
- **Act 3** (Slides 8-10): Address objections, differentiate, drive action

**Narrative prompt**:
```
Based on these extracted insights:
[PASTE STEP 1 RESULTS]

Create a narrative arc that:
1. Opens with a hook tied to their #1 pain point
2. Frames the problem in business terms (cost, risk, opportunity)
3. Positions our solution as the logical answer
4. Quantifies the value in their terms
5. Closes with a confident, specific ask

Keep the through-line focused on THEIR transformation, not our features.
```

### Step 3: Generate Slide Content

Create detailed content for each slide following this template:

**For each slide**:
```
## Slide [N]: [Title]

**Visual suggestion**: [Image/chart/diagram type]

**Headline**: [One sentence, <10 words]

**Body** (3-5 bullets):
- [Specific, quantified point]
- [Customer-centric benefit]
- [Proof or credibility element]

**Speaker notes**: [What to emphasize, objection handling, transition]

**Design notes**: [Color, layout, emphasis areas]
```

**Content generation prompt**:
```
Generate all 10 slides using this structure:
- Slide 1 (Hook): Start with their #1 pain point as a provocative question or stat
- Slide 2 (Problem): Use their words to describe current state challenges
- Slide 3 (Market): Tie to industry trends that create urgency
- Slide 4 (Solution): High-level "what" in one sentence + visual concept
- Slide 5 (How): 3-4 key capabilities that directly address pain points
- Slide 6 (Value): ROI calculator or quantified outcomes specific to them
- Slide 7 (Proof): 2-3 relevant case studies with metrics
- Slide 8 (Differentiation): Head-to-head comparison on decision criteria
- Slide 9 (Implementation): 30/60/90 day plan with milestones
- Slide 10 (CTA): Specific next step with timeline

Context:
- Client: [CLIENT_NAME]
- Primary Contacts: [PRIMARY_CONTACTS]
- Solution Provider Company: [SOLUTION_PROVIDER_COMPANY]
- Engagement Type: Exploration | Feasibility Study | Training | Audit | Implementation | Maintenance | Staffing | Other
- Solution: [SOLUTION_NAME]
- Timeline: [TIMELINE]
- Key pain points: [FROM STEP 1]
- Decision criteria: [FROM STEP 1]
- Value metrics: [FROM STEP 1]
- Payment Terms: [PAYMENT_TERMS] (e.g. Due Upfront to Activate Exploration.)
```

### Step 4: Add Proof and Personalization

Enhance the deck with:

- **Quantified outcomes**: Replace vague benefits with specific numbers
- **Social proof**: Add relevant customer logos, testimonials, metrics
- **Personalization**: Insert company name, industry terms, stakeholder names
- **Risk reversal**: Address objections proactively in speaker notes
- **Urgency elements**: Timeline constraints, limited availability, competitive pressure

**Enhancement prompt**:
```
Review the generated deck and add:
1. Specific metrics for each value claim (time saved, cost reduced, revenue increased)
2. Industry-specific terminology from the source material
3. Personalized examples mentioning [COMPANY_NAME] by name
4. Objection handling for concerns raised in discovery: [LIST CONCERNS]
5. Urgency drivers tied to their timeline: [TIMELINE FROM SOURCE]
6. Visual cues for key decision criteria: [DECISION FACTORS]

Make every slide pass the "so what?" test from their perspective.
```

### Step 5: Optimize for Delivery

Refine for presentation:

- **Slide titles**: Make them headlines, not labels (benefits, not features)
- **Bullet economy**: Max 5 bullets per slide, <15 words each
- **Visual hierarchy**: Primary message stands alone without body text
- **Speaker notes**: Add transitions, objection handling, engagement questions
- **Backup slides**: Prepare 3-5 detailed slides for anticipated deep-dives

**Optimization prompt**:
```
Refine the deck for executive presentation:
1. Convert all slide titles to benefit statements (not "Our Solution" but "Cut Deployment Time 80%")
2. Reduce bullet verbosity by 30% - keep only essential words
3. Flag slides that need strong visuals (data viz, diagrams, screenshots)
4. Add speaker notes for:
   - Transition phrases between slides
   - How to handle likely objections
   - Questions to engage audience
   - Personal stories or examples to share
5. Create 3 backup slides for deep-dive topics: [TECHNICAL DETAILS, ROI METHODOLOGY, IMPLEMENTATION RESOURCES]
```

### Step 6: Format and Export

Generate the final deliverable:

**Markdown format** (default):
```markdown
# [COMPANY_NAME] - [SOLUTION_NAME] Pitch Deck

## Slide 1: [Title]
...
```

**JSON format** (for programmatic use):
```json
{
  "deck_metadata": {
    "company": "...",
    "solution": "...",
    "created": "...",
    "slide_count": 10
  },
  "slides": [...]
}
```

**Outline format** (for quick review):
```
1. Hook: [One-line summary]
2. Problem: [One-line summary]
...
```

## Validation Checklist

Before delivering, verify:

- [ ] Each slide has one clear primary message
- [ ] Problem definition uses customer's language from source material
- [ ] Value proposition is quantified with specific metrics
- [ ] At least 2 proof points with measurable outcomes
- [ ] Differentiation addresses specific competitive alternatives mentioned
- [ ] CTA is concrete (meeting, trial, contract) with clear next steps
- [ ] No slide exceeds 5 bullets or 75 words
- [ ] Speaker notes provide objection handling for concerns raised
- [ ] Deck tells a coherent story when read titles-only
- [ ] Personalization includes company name in at least 3 slides

## Best Practices

**Do**:
- Start with their problem, not your solution
- Use their words and metrics from the source
- Quantify everything (time, cost, quality, risk)
- Make titles actionable benefits
- Design for skimmers (execs read titles + charts only)
- Include a confident, specific ask

**Don't**:
- Lead with company history or "about us"
- Use internal jargon or feature lists
- Make unsubstantiated claims
- Overcrowd slides (white space = confidence)
- End with "Thank you" (end with the ask)
- Forget speaker notes for objection handling

## Example Execution

```
Input: Discovery call transcript where prospect mentions:
- Current deployment takes 4 hours, error-prone
- Manual config causes 15% of production incidents
- Team of 8 wastes 20 hours/week on toil
- Need solution deployed before Q4 product launch
- Evaluating competitor and build-in-house options

Output: Deck with:
- Hook: "What if deployment went from 4 hours to 5 minutes?"
- Problem: Current state costing 160 hours/month in toil
- Value: $180K annual savings + 15% incident reduction
- Proof: Similar company reduced MTTR by 75% in 60 days
- Differentiation: Table comparing us vs. competitor vs. build
- CTA: "Pilot deployment for Q3 product launch - start next week"
```

## Customization Options

Adapt for different contexts:

- **Enterprise sale**: Add governance, security, compliance slides
- **SMB sale**: Emphasize speed to value, simplicity, cost efficiency
- **Technical audience**: Include architecture diagram, integration details
- **Economic buyer**: Focus on ROI, TCO, strategic alignment
- **Champion enablement**: Add internal selling toolkit, FAQ, comparison sheet
