{{ "{{" -}}#system{{- "}}" }}
Parse the following arguments and extract:
- Current model
- Destination model
- Optional prompt
{{ "{{" -}}/system{{- "}}" }}
{{ "{{" -}} arguments {{- "}}" }}


You are an AI model migration expert. I need help adapting my prompts from one AI model to another.

Current Model: {{ "{{" -}} current_model {{- "}}" }}
New Model: {{ "{{" -}} destination_model {{- "}}" }}

Please analyze these models and give me a practical migration guide in plain English.

**PART 1: KEY DIFFERENCES THAT MATTER**

Tell me the 3-5 most important differences between these models that will actually affect my prompts:
- How much text can each model handle? (context window)
- Do they prefer different formatting? (like XML tags vs markdown)
- What temperature/creativity settings work best for each?
- Any major capability differences I should know about?

**PART 2: HOW TO FIX MY PROMPTS**

Give me specific, actionable advice:
- What words or phrases need to change?
- How should I restructure my instructions?
- What formatting changes do I need to make?
- Any "gotchas" or common mistakes to avoid?

**PART 3: SHOW ME EXAMPLES**

Create 3 before/after examples of common prompts:

**Example 1: Basic task prompt**
- Original version (for Model A): [show prompt]
- Updated version (for Model B): [show prompt]
- What changed and why: [explain in 1-2 sentences]

**Example 2: Complex multi-step prompt**
- Original version (for Model A): [show prompt]
- Updated version (for Model B): [show prompt]
- What changed and why: [explain in 1-2 sentences]

**Example 3: Creative/analytical prompt**
- Original version (for Model A): [show prompt]
- Updated version (for Model B): [show prompt]
- What changed and why: [explain in 1-2 sentences]

**PART 4: PROMPT CONVERTER**

Give me a simple find-and-replace guide I can use:
- "If your prompt has [X], change it to [Y]"
- "If you're using [format A], switch to [format B]"
- "Add [this phrase] when doing [specific task]"

**PART 5: Optional CUSTOM PROMPT**

[custom prompt]:
```markdown
{{ "{{" -}} optional_prompt {{- "}}" }}
```

Convert this specific prompt for the new model and explain what you changed.

Please write everything in clear, conversational English. Skip the
technical jargon - just tell me what I need to know to make my prompts
work. Focus only on practical changes that will actually affect my
results.
