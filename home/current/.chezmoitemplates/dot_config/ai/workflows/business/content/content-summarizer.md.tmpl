# YouTube Transcript → Obsidian Note

 Purpose: Given a pasted transcript that includes linked timecodes, produce an Obsidian-ready note with rich YAML frontmatter, aliases, tags, and themed sections. The body should be organized by content (not strictly by video timeline). Key points must include footnote-style backlinks to the timecode where the discussion starts.

## Inputs

 Provide at least the transcript. When available, include the video URL.

- Required
  - Transcript text including timecodes with links.
- Optional
  - Video URL (e.g., `https://youtu.be/<id>`  or `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<id>` )
  - Title override, tags, aliases, scope focus, and advanced behavior flags via Args.

## Args (adjust behavior)

- note_title: override final note title.
- tags: array of tags to add (e.g., `["youtube", "topic/ai"]` ).
- aliases: array of aliases (e.g., `["Alt Title", "Short Name"]` ).
- scope_focus: optional; comma-separated topics to prioritize; drop unrelated content.
- summarize_level: one of `ultra-brief` , `brief` , `standard` , `detailed`  (default).
- include_quotes: boolean; include selected quotes with timecode backlinks.
- include_action_items: boolean; create an Action Items section.
- include_glossary: boolean; create a Glossary section of key terms.
- include_code: boolean; include code/config snippets if present.
- language: ISO code (e.g., `en` ); adjust tone and headings accordingly.
- section_order: optional array of section names to prefer first.
- auto_link_related: boolean; auto-suggest related internal notes and external links.

## Extraction Targets (from transcript and/or fetched metadata)

- Video Title
- Video URL
- Channel Name
- Channel URL
- Duration
- Synopsis/Description
- Release Date

 If any are missing in the transcript, infer from context or the provided video URL. Use the timecode links present in the transcript to form backlinks.

## Transform Rules

- Organize content into major thematic sections; do not mirror the video timeline.
- For main/key points or claims, add a footnote referencing the earliest timecode where this topic begins, linking back to the YouTube URL with `&t=<seconds>s`  (or `?t=<seconds>`  for youtu.be).
- Use Obsidian-compatible Markdown:
  - YAML frontmatter with `aliases`  and `tags`  arrays.
  - External links with `[Title](https://...)` .
  - Internal links with `[[Note Name]]` .
- If scope narrowing is requested (via `scope_focus` ), explicitly state the narrowed scope and skip unrelated content.
- If the video mentions external tools/sites, link them as external Markdown links.
- If you’re aware of additional authoritative resources on the same topic, include them in Related Resources (mark as external links) and suggest internal link candidates.

## Output Format

 Produce exactly one Markdown note:

 1) YAML Frontmatter

 ```yaml
 ---
 # Prefer provided args; fall back to parsed values from the transcript/URL
 # Use ISO dates and a consistent tag scheme
 # Examples for illustration; fill with actual extracted values
 #
 title: "{{- "{{" }} .note_title | default "<Video Title>" {{ "}}" -}}"
 aliases:
   - {{- /* list aliases if provided/extracted */ -}}
   - "<Alt Title>"
   - "<Short Name>"
 tags:
   - youtube
   - video
   # - topic/<primary-topic>
   # - channel/<slugified-channel>
 date-created: <YYYY-MM-DD>
 date-updated: <YYYY-MM-DD>

 source:
   urls: ["<Video URL>"]
   timecoded: true
   channel:
     name: "<Channel Name>"
     url: "<Channel URL>"
   duration: "<HH:MM:SS>"
   release_date: "<YYYY-MM-DD>"
   synopsis: |
     <1-3 sentence synopsis; reflect actual description/context>

 render:
  summarize_level: {{ if hasKey . "summarize_level" }}{{ index . "summarize_level" }}{{ else }}standard{{ end }}
  include_quotes: {{ if hasKey . "include_quotes" }}{{ index . "include_quotes" }}{{ else }}true{{ end }}
  include_action_items: {{ if hasKey . "include_action_items" }}{{ index . "include_action_items" }}{{ else }}true{{ end }}
  include_glossary: {{ if hasKey . "include_glossary" }}{{ index . "include_glossary" }}{{ else }}false{{ end }}
  include_code: {{ if hasKey . "include_code" }}{{ index . "include_code" }}{{ else }}false{{ end }}
  language: {{ if hasKey . "language" }}{{ index . "language" }}{{ else }}"en"{{ end }}
  scope_focus: {{ if hasKey . "scope_focus" }}{{ index . "scope_focus" }}{{ else }}""{{ end }}
 ---
 ```

 2) Body (thematic, not timeline-aligned)

- Overview
  - Brief orientation and scope note. If `scope_focus`  is present, call it out and list inclusions/exclusions.
- Major Sections (thematic)
  - Section headings named by content topics; group related transcript segments across the timeline.
  - For each key point, add a footnote backlink to its start timecode.
- Optional Sections (include per args)
  - Action Items (bulleted, specific, testable)
  - Glossary (term: definition)
  - Code & Config (if relevant)
- Related Resources
  - Internal: `[[Existing Note]]`  suggestions
  - External: `[Resource Title](https://example.com)`
- About the Contributors
 	- Channel Link
 	- YouTuber Link n
  		- Other Socials
- Interesting Quotes
 	- Choose at least 5 quotes that are useful references and attribute them to the speakers or the person who the quote was from. If the person isn't active on social media, use a wikipedia or similar page to link to
- Notes
- Footnotes block (timecode backlinks live here)
- Full Transcripts (timecode backlinks live here)

## Footnote Backlink Conventions

- Use `[^tc-<slug>]`  markers inline, with definitions at the end.
- Footnote text should be: `Starts at HH:MM:SS`  → link to `Video URL + time` .
- For `youtu.be/<id>` , prefer `?t=<seconds>` ; for `watch?v=<id>` , prefer `&t=<seconds>s` ```.
- If multiple timecodes relate to a point, prefer the earliest starting segment.

## Algorithm (High-Level Steps)

 1. Check for Existing Notes
    - Before creating a new note, search the vault for existing documents on the same topic.
    - If related notes are found, decide whether to:
      - Create a new note and add cross-links to the existing ones.
      - Update an existing document if the new information is minimal or a direct update.

 2. Parse Inputs
    - Detect base video URL if present in the transcript or provided separately.
    - Extract all timecodes and their target links; normalize to total seconds.
    - Attempt to extract title, channel, duration, description, release date from transcript preface or link previews. When absent, mark TODOs politely in frontmatter fields.

 3. Determine Scope
    - If `scope_focus`  is set, compile list of priority topics and exclude unrelated material. Add an explicit Scope note to Overview.

 4. Topic Modeling and Sectioning
    - Cluster transcript paragraphs by topic; label clusters with concise section titles.
    - Summarize each cluster at the requested `summarize_level` .
    - Identify key points; map each to its earliest relevant timecode.

 5. Draft Frontmatter
    - Build `title` , `aliases` , `tags`  arrays.
    - Populate `source`  fields; format dates ISO YYYY-MM-DD; duration `HH:MM:SS` .
    - Set `render`  block with actual arg values.

 6. Compose Body
    - Overview with synopsis and scope.
    - Thematic sections with bullet points; add footnote markers after key claims.
    - Optional sections per args.
    - Related resources
      - Internal: suggest `[[Topic Note]]`  links based on subject.
      - External: add authoritative links (official docs, standards, seminal articles).

 7. Footnotes
    - For each `[^tc-...]` , define at bottom with: `[^tc-xyz]: Starts at HH:MM:SS — <Video URL with time param>` .

## Output Template

{{ includeTemplate "dot_config/ai/templates/business/comms/content/video-summary.md.tmpl" .}}

## Notes

- Always keep sections thematic; avoid one section per timestamp.
- When adding external sites, use full Markdown links. Do not leave bare names.
- If some metadata cannot be reliably derived, leave a clear TODO in frontmatter fields for manual fill.
- Keep footnotes minimal and descriptive; one per unique starting point is usually sufficient.

## Transcripts

- Use timecodes if they are available making them links into the video at the timecode
