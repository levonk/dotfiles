# Apply Feature: Single Chokepoint Logging @ v1

- Create `src/infra/logging/` (TS) or `app/infra/logging/` (Py)
- Add facade, adapters, and redaction helpers
- Replace direct console/print usages gradually with facade
- Run lints and tests

## Steps
1. Generate files from templates.
2. Wire the facade in a leaf module; propagate replacement incrementally.
3. Run lints and tests.
4. Commit with message: "feat: logging single chokepoint @v1".
