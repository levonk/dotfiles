# Best Practices for Production-Ready Workflows

## 1. Reliability and Resilience
- Error handling and retries: expect failures (API limits, timeouts, etc...). Build in retries, back offs, and the error workflows.
- Fail gracefully: dead letter workflows, human review cues, or fallback notifications.
- Idempotency: design so if the job runs twice it doesn't duplicate records or send duplicate emails.

## 2. Observability
- Centralized logging: push execution data to something like Elk/DataDog.
- Centralized metrics: push metrics to something like Elk/DataDog.
- Centralized tracing: push traces to something like Elk/DataDog.
- Centralized profiling: push profiles to something like Elk/DataDog.
- Centralized alerts: push alerts to something like Elk/DataDog.
- Centralized notifications: push notifications to something like Elk/DataDog.

## 3. Security & Compliance
- Secrets in environment variables, not hard-coded in nodes
- Sensitive data not logged in any form
- Role-Based Access Control for Team Members
- HTTPS everywhere! Encryption at rest.
- Audit logs of changes so you know who deployed what and when. Who did what and when?
- Consider whether any API endpoints, public domains, websites, or URLs need access control and authorization.
- Add bird rails to prevent somebody from intentionally running up your costs On APIs and services.

## 4. Scalability and Performance
- Load balancing: distribute traffic evenly across nodes.
- Use Postgres/mysql instead of SQLite for data storage.
- Use Redis for caching and session management.
- Design with queues (RabbitMQ, Redis, SQS) for high-volume workloads.
- Use a CDN for static assets.
- Use a reverse proxy (Nginx, Traefik) for load balancing and SSL termination.
- Use a load balancer (AWS ELB, Nginx, Traefik) for load balancing and SSL termination.
- Avoid pulling in huge data sets into memory; stream or batch them instead.

## 5. Maintainability
- Make extensive use of version control. Check in small units of changes.
- Documentation: Inline notes everywhere that it would help maintain it later.
- Naming conventions:
- Nodes and variables should be descriptive.
- Templates and patterns: standardized error handling, logging, and retries across workflows and modules.
- Use multiple modules.
- Break large modules into smaller modules if they are doing too much.
- Break up large files into smaller files if they are doing too much.
- Break up large classes into smaller classes if they are doing too much.
- Break up large functions into smaller functions if they are doing too much.
- Break deep nested code into smaller, more focused functions.
- Use a consistent naming convention for files, classes, functions, and variables.
- Check for existence of tables, API endpoints, integrations, environment variables, config files, config options, variables, classes, types, utilities, modules, files, or directories before creating new ones.
- When creating new versions of the above, always examine the existing ones for standards to replicate.
- Dry: Don't repeat yourself. Leverage configuration tables or files to replicate functionality with slight changes.

## 6. Testing
- Unit tests: test individual units of code.
- Integration tests: test the integration of different units of code.
- End-to-end tests: test the end-to-end flow of the application.
- Load tests: test the application under load.
- Security tests: test the application for security vulnerabilities.
- Performance tests: test the application for performance.
- Mock data: Have data that is a representative of what you'll see outside so you can run tests effectively.
- Mock services: Have services that are a representative of what you'll see outside so you can run tests effectively.
- Mock integrations: Have integrations that are a representative of what you'll see outside so you can run tests effectively.
- Mock environment variables: Have environment variables that are a representative of what you'll see outside so you can run tests effectively.
- Mock config files: Have config files that are a representative of what you'll see outside so you can run tests effectively.
- Mock config options: Have config options that are a representative of what you'll see outside so you can run tests effectively.
- Mock variables: Have variables that are a representative of what you'll see outside so you can run tests effectively.
- Mock classes: Have classes that are a representative of what you'll see outside so you can run tests effectively.
- Mock types: Have types that are a representative of what you'll see outside so you can run tests effectively.
- Mock utilities: Have utilities that are a representative of what you'll see outside so you can run tests effectively.
- Mock modules: Have modules that are a representative of what you'll see outside so you can run tests effectively.
- Mock files: Have files that are a representative of what you'll see outside so you can run tests effectively.
- Mock directories: Have directories that are a representative of what you'll see outside so you can run tests effectively.
- Mock API endpoints: Have API endpoints that are a representative of what you'll see outside so you can run tests effectively.
- Mock integrations: Have integrations that are a representative of what you'll see outside so you can run tests effectively.
- Have staging and production environments. Don't test live on customer data.

## 7. Deployment & Change Management
- Use a CI/CD pipeline.
- Use a deployment strategy that minimizes downtime.
- Use a rollback strategy.
- Use a canary deployment strategy.
- Use a blue-green deployment strategy.
- Use a feature flag strategy.
- Infrastructure is code whether that's Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, or otherwise.
- Have effective communication with customers.

## 8. Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery
- Have a backup strategy.
- Have a disaster recovery runbooks.
- Have a business continuity runbooks.
- Have a failover strategy.
- Identify availability and redundancy commitments from services and upstream suppliers.
