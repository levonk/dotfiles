# Principles And Checklists

- **[Progressive disclosure]**
  - Show essentials first; reveal detail after engagement (expanders, steps, zoom levels, "read more").
  - For forms, ask for one low-friction field first (e.g., email), then show additional fields.

- **[Fix the contact section]**
  - Replace redundant headings like "Contact us" with a benefit-driven headline that answers "Why submit this form now?".
  - Add 3–5 supporting benefits.
  - Explain what happens next (process, timeline, who responds).
  - Place social proof (reviews/testimonials/trust logos) adjacent to the form.

- **[Use specific numbers]**
  - Replace vague claims with quantified facts: counts, % lifts, time saved.
  - Prefer “50,400 happy customers” to “trusted by thousands.”

- **[Eliminate dead zones / wasted space]**
  - Minimize unnecessary whitespace; ensure key content is visible above the fold, especially on mobile.
  - Each section must earn the right to keep the user engaged; avoid pushing value below the fold.

- **[Headline-first comprehension]**
  - Assume users read only headlines. Ensure headlines alone communicate the core value.
  - Avoid generic/clever; write clear, benefit-oriented headlines.

- **[Sell benefits, not features]**
  - Apply the “so that…” ladder to connect features → outcomes → business impact.
  - Example: “Land more inbox placements so that you reach more people so that you book more meetings so that you close more deals.”

- **[Treat every page as a landing page]**
  - Users may arrive on any page (homepage/services/SEO pages). Apply the same conversion standards to all entrances.
  - Map layout to traffic source and awareness stage:
    - Meta/interrupt ads: visitors are problem/unaware; lead with education, pain→solution, trust building before asking for a form.
    - Google Ads/SEO: visitors are solution-aware/ready to buy; can place form ATF and be more direct; still reinforce proof and differentiators.

- **[Reduce FUD at points of action]**
  - Near CTAs/forms, reduce fear, uncertainty, and doubt with: “No credit card required,” free trial, easy cancellation, money-back guarantees, security badges, or nearby social proof.

- **[Prioritize above the fold]**
  - Spend 90% of effort here; 100% see it, ~60% never scroll.
  - Include: benefit headline, reinforcing subcopy, primary CTA (action-oriented), social proof, and a complementary visual.
  - Tighten whitespace; surface proof or key stats ATF (especially on mobile). Eliminate large empty blocks that push value below the fold.
  - Allocate 80–90% of the first iteration’s effort to ATF; keep the “~60% never scroll” stat visible in briefs to maintain focus.

- **[Clarity over cleverness]**
  - Instantly answer: What is this? Who is it for? What should I do next?
  - Remove jargon and vague slogans that don’t map to the offer.
  - Subheadline pattern: “Stop doing X / No more Y. Our solution does X, Y, Z (mechanism, timeline).”

- **[Subtract first]**
  - Reduce choices and distractions (paradox of choice). Remove non-essential buttons/links competing with the primary goal.

- **[Images that sell]**
  - Use visuals to explain the product/service and reinforce the value prop. Avoid irrelevant stock art.

- **[Visual hierarchy]**
  - Establish a clear typographic and spatial hierarchy (H1/H2/body/CTA). Guide the eye intentionally.

- **[Reduce redundant form fields]**
  - Ask only what’s necessary for the next step. Combine first/last name into full name if possible. Avoid asking for both company and website.

- **[Design quality matters]**
  - Credibility is judged by design quality (especially for high-ticket B2B). Keep it clean, branded, and professional without gimmicks.

- **[F and Z scanning patterns]**
  - Place headline, subheadline, and CTA along natural scan paths.

- **[Use a proven layout]**
  - Don’t reinvent the wheel. Follow a known block order (Hero → Problem → Solution → Value Props → Proof → CTA → FAQ → Closer).

- **[Single-column forms]**
  - Prefer single-column. If many fields are required, use multi-step with progress indicators.

- **[CTAs throughout the journey]**
  - Place primary CTAs at logical points: top, mid, and bottom. Users convert when they’re ready.
  - Target CTA button CTR: 3–5% per major section; if lower, improve prominence, affordance, copy, and proximity to value.

- **[Sales-call structure]**
  - Lead with the problem, then goals, then solution; longer pages are fine if they build trust and address multiple motivations.

- **[Social proof above the fold]**
  - Include relevant, credible proof early (logos, ratings, select reviews). Tailor to audience size/stage.
  - Prefer two proof elements ATF (e.g., logos + star ratings or short pull-quotes). Avoid external links that pull visitors off-page; keep focus on conversion.

- **[Comparison tables]**
  - Use when buyers are in comparison mode. Highlight meaningful differentiators vs. status quo/competitors.
  - Use checkmarks/Xs for quick scanning; add one-line clarifications where nuance matters.

- **[Proof near claims]**
  - Back each key claim with a nearby testimonial or data point that states the same benefit in a customer’s words.
  - “Wall of love” section works: cluster short, titled testimonials (include source logo e.g., Google/Trustpilot) and video proof; avoid carousels on mobile.

- **[Closer section at bottom]**
  - Repeat the hero in condensed form (benefit headline, bullets, social proof, FUD reducers, CTA) for bottom skimmers.

- **[Data > opinions]**
  - Instrument heatmaps/scrollmaps (e.g., Microsoft Clarity). Read click and scroll depth alongside conversions.

- **[Use “you” language]**
  - Focus on the reader’s outcomes. Shift from “we do” to “you get.”

- **[Credible testimonials]**
  - Add photos, names, roles, source logos (Google/Capterra/etc.). Favor verifiable reviews; video proof if possible.

- **[Always be testing]**
  - AB test headlines, CTAs, images, layouts. Compound small wins into big gains.

- **[FAQs as objection handlers]**
  - Curate questions from sales calls. Address cost, risk, time, fit, proof—before the call.

- **[Mobile has its own design]**
  - Design mobile explicitly (layout, font sizes, media, tap targets). Don’t merely shrink desktop.

- **[Speed with sense]**
  - Optimize for reasonable speed, but don’t destroy clarity/design for a few milliseconds. A clear, credible page wins.

- **[Qualitative + quantitative]**
  - Pair analytics with moderated/unmoderated user tests (e.g., UserBrain). Ask first-impression and task-completion questions.
  - In Clarity: filter session recordings by converters (thank-you page path) to study winning paths; also review rage clicks and area click maps.
  - In heat/scroll maps: track average fold, 75%/50%/25% reach. If critical sections are below typical reach, move them up.
  - For user tests: instruct participants to think aloud and confirm task completion; this improves insight density.
  - Screening: avoid simple yes/no. Prefer decision-role, involvement-level, device, geo; predefine approve/reject criteria.
  - Case-study reach rule: if <50% of users reach case studies in scroll maps, elevate case studies higher and tighten ATF spacing.

# Above-The-Fold (ATF) Checklist

- **[ATF must contain]**
  - Benefit headline that states the outcome.
  - Subheadline that reinforces and clarifies.
  - Primary CTA with an action verb and outcome (e.g., “Get free strategy plan”).
  - Social proof (logos, stars, short quote) relevant to the audience.
  - Visual that supports the copy (screenshot/product-in-context/short loop).
  - Optional: ATF form variant for high-intent traffic; include benefit headline, 3–4 bullets, primary CTA, and a small risk reducer under the CTA.

# Form Optimization Checklist

- **[Friction reduction]**
  - No cc required, free trial, easy cancel, money-back guarantees near CTA/form.
  - Social proof at the point of form entry.
- **[Fields]**
  - Remove redundant fields; ask for essentials only.
  - Use progressive disclosure/steps; single column preferred.
  - Combine first/last into full name where possible; don’t ask for both company and website.
  - Use labels separate from placeholders to reduce errors, especially on mobile.
  - Place a small trust element (e.g., “No cc required,” security badge) directly under the primary CTA.

## Navigation & Sticky Actions

- Keep landing pages distraction-free; avoid standard nav links. Use sticky bar with only a primary CTA and (for services) a click-to-call phone number. Ensure both remain accessible while scrolling, particularly on mobile.

## E‑commerce Specific Patterns

- Make product selection seamless; show bundle savings explicitly (don’t force math). Add trust builders near Add to Cart; use a slide-out cart (not a full page refresh) to cross/upsell and improve AOV.

# Copy Prompts For The AI

- **[Benefit headline prompt]**
  - “Write a clear, specific benefit headline that answers ‘What do I get?’ for [ICP] in [context]. Include a number if credible.”
- **[Subheadline prompt]**
  - “Reinforce the value with one sentence clarifying who it’s for and the mechanism. Keep it concrete and jargon-free.”
- **[CTA prompt]**
  - “Propose 3 CTA variants with action verbs and outcome language. Keep each ≤ 5 words.”
- **[So-that ladder]**
  - “Given features [F1..Fn], produce a ‘so that…’ ladder that ends in a business outcome for [ICP].”
- **[Proof pairing]**
  - “For each key claim, select or draft one sentence of testimonial/social proof that echoes the claim in a customer’s words.”
- **[FAQ generator]**
  - “Draft FAQs that address the top 6 objections from sales calls: cost, risk, time, ROI proof, fit, implementation.”

# Layout Skeleton (Wireframe Order)

1. Hero (benefit headline, subcopy, CTA, proof, visual)
2. Problem/Pain (empathy, stakes)
3. Solution/How it works (progressive disclosure; visual)
4. Value props (3–5 benefits with numbers)
5. Social proof cluster (logos, reviews, case stats)
6. Comparison table (vs. status quo/competitors) [if relevant]
7. Objection handling (FUD reducers, guarantees)
8. CTA block (action + outcome)
9. FAQ (objection pre-handling)
10. Closer (repeat hero essentials)

# Success Metrics And Instrumentation

- **[KPIs]** conversion rate (lead/demo/bookings), CTR on CTAs, scroll depth, section clickmaps, form completion rate and field drop-off.
- **[Tools]** Microsoft Clarity (heat/scroll maps, session replays), Google Analytics (events), AB testing platform.
- **[Stat hygiene]** Use comparable traffic windows; avoid confounders (promo, outages, seasonality) when judging tests.
 - **[A/B thresholds]** For <25–30k monthly visitors on a single page, prefer iterative design improvements + qual/Clarity over formal A/B tests; for higher traffic, run A/B or split-URL tests with clear goals (e.g., thank-you page views).

# Guardrails

- **[Honesty]** Use truthful, verifiable numbers; no fabricated stats.
- **[Relevance]** Proof and examples must match the target ICP and use case.
- **[Accessibility]** Maintain contrast, semantic headings, alt text for key images, and keyboard navigation.
- **[Performance sanity]** Optimize images/media; do not sacrifice clarity for negligible speed gains.

# Output Requirements (When Generating A Landing Page)

- **[Deliverables]**
  - ATF copy (headline, subhead, CTA variants, proof snippet, visual suggestion).
  - Full-page outline using the Layout Skeleton.
  - 3 value-prop blocks with numeric proof.
  - Comparison table (if applicable).
  - 6 FAQs tied to objections.
  - Footer ‘closer’ CTA block.
- **[Tone]** Clear > clever; “you” > “we”; numbers > adjectives.
- **[Mobile]** Provide mobile-specific notes for ATF and CTA placement.
