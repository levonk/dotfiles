description: Code Review
---
- Think through how data flows in the app. Explain new patterns, if they exist, and why.
- Were there any changes that could affect:
	- infrastructure, build, deployment
	- Schemas
	- Integrations
	- security
	- performance
	- maintainability
	- accessibility
	- compatibility
	- portability
	- licensing
	- subscriptions
	- profit
	- compliance or legal issues
	- Offline support
- Consider empty, loading error, and offline states.
- Review front-end changes for:
	- A11y 
		- keyboard navigation
		- Focus management
		- ARIA roles
		- Color contrast
	- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
	- Responsive design
	- Error handling
	- Loading states
	- Accessibility
- If public APIs or Types have changed, ensure backwards compatibility or increment the API version.
- Are there any unnecessary dependencies added? If there is a heavy dependency, could we inline a more minimal version?
- Did we add quality tests? Prefer fewer high-quality tests? Prefer integration tests for user flows.
- Were there schema changes which could require a database migration?
- Changes to auth flows or permissions? Run /security-review.
- If feature flags are set up, does this change require adding a new one?
- If I18N is set up, are the strings added localized, and new routes internationalized?
- Are there places we should use caching?
- Are we missing critical O11y or logging on backend changes?
- Are we missing any important metrics?
