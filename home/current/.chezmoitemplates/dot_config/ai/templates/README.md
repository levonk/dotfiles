# AI Templates — Overview

This directory organizes reusable templates for business and people operations.
It follows consistent naming conventions so files are discoverable by audience and cadence.

## Structure

- `business/people-ops/status/` — status report templates by audience and cadence
- `business/people-ops/one-on-ones/` — 1:1 agendas by audience and cadence
- `business/people-ops/manager/` — manager relationship docs (kickoff, emails, 30/60/90)
- `business/people-ops/onboarding/` — onboarding plans and announcements
- `business/projects/` — project kickoffs and governance (RAID, RACI)
- `business/comms/engagement/` — client/internal engagement kickoff emails

## Naming conventions
