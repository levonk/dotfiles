# Code Review Checklist

## How to use
- Use this as a pre-merge checklist.
- Discuss exceptions explicitly in the PR.

## Correctness
- [ ] Logic matches requirements; edge cases handled
- [ ] Idempotency and retries where needed
- [ ] Concurrency and async correctness

## Security
- [ ] No secrets; proper authz/authn; input validation
- [ ] Cryptography and storage policies followed

## Performance
- [ ] No needless N+1; memory/CPU hot paths reviewed
- [ ] Batch/stream large data; avoid blocking I/O

## Reliability & Ops
- [ ] Errors handled; timeouts; circuit breakers
- [ ] Logs/metrics/traces added with context

## Testing
- [ ] Unit/integration/e2e updated; negative tests
- [ ] Flaky tests addressed; coverage reasonable

## Maintainability
- [ ] Clear names; small functions; DRY
- [ ] Docs and comments where helpful

## Release Safety
- [ ] Migrations safe; backward compatible APIs
- [ ] Feature flags/rollout toggles in place
