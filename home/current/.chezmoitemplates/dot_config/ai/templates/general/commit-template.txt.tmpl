#
# |[----  Using a Maximum Of 50 Characters  ----]|
  # 1. Summary (50 characters max, including type prefix):
  #        - Be concise and descriptive.
  #        - Start with [COMMIT-TYPE] from the list below
  #        - in parens following [COMMIT-TYPE] add the module/section of codebase that is being changed e.g. `doc(architecture)
  #        - The summary should be a single line.
  #        - Keep lines to 50 characters or less.
  #        - Use imperative mood ("Add feature" instead of "Adding feature").
  #        - like GitHub. Imperative mood conveys the action taken.
  #        - Reference issue numbers if applicable (e.g., "Fix bug #123").
  #        - Reason: Limits ensure readability in Git logs and on platforms
  #        - There should be one blank line following the summary

# |[---------------  Using a Maximum Of 72 Characters  ---------------]|
  # 2. Body (Optional):
  #        - Provide more context and details about the change.
  #        - Explain why the change was made and the problem it solves.
  #        - Use multiple paragraphs if necessary.
  #        - Keep lines to 72 characters or less.
  #        - Reason: The body provides context the summary cannot; why often matters more than what.
  #        - There should be one blank line following the body

# |[-------------  Footer (Using a Max Of 72 Characters)  ------------]|
  # 3. Footer (Optional):
  #        - Breaking Changes: If the commit introduces a breaking change, describe it in detail.
  #          This is crucial for communicating the impact to other developers.
  #        - References: Link to related documentation, discussions, or external resources.
  #        - Closes: #issue-number (automatically closes the issue on merge in some platforms like GitHub).
  #        - Reason: The footer provides metadata like breaking changes and references.

#  COMMIT TYPES:
#  - feat:      A new feature
#  - fix:       A bug fix
#  - doc:      Documentation changes
#  - style:     Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
#  - refactor:  A code change that neither adds a feature nor fixes a bug
#  - perf:      A code change that improves performance
#  - test:      Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
#  - build:     Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
#  - ci:        Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
#  - chore:     Other changes that don't modify src or test files
#  - revert:    Reverts a previous commit

#
#   Commit grouping guidance:
#   - Group changes into coherent commits by functionality or behavior, not by file type or layer.
#   - Each commit should tell one story reviewers and tools can follow end-to-end.
#   - Example A: "Login flow: fix password validation and update docs/config/TS/CSS/tests" — one commit.
#   - Example B: "Settings page: persist theme to DB and update UI/tests" — a different commit.
#   - Avoid commits sliced by file type like "code files" vs "test files"; keep related cross-cutting changes together.

#
#  Pre-commit checklist (process; not part of the message):
#  - Secrets: Scan for secrets or sensitive data; remove or rotate if found.
#  - Format/Lint: Run formatter and linters; fix issues or stage generated changes.
#  - Tests: Run unit/integration tests; ensure green locally, or explain intentional failures in the body.

#
#  Commit message style reminders (content):
#  - Be specific: prefer "fix overflow in sidebar menu" over "fix bug".
#  - Avoid filler: skip vague phrases like "oops" or "maybe fixed".
#  - Subject: Capitalize the subject; omit trailing punctuation.
#  - Line endings: Use LF for commit messages, not CRLF.

# Type: Subject
#  - Choose a commit type from the list above (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, etc.).
#  - Use a single, clear subject line.
#  - **Reason:** Commit types categorize the nature of the change, aiding
#    in filtering and automated tasks. Clear subject lines provide a
#    concise overview.

# Body
#  - Elaborate on the changes made in this commit.
#  - Explain the reasoning behind the changes.
#  - Provide context for reviewers.
#  - Use Markdown formatting for readability.
#  - **Reason:** The body expands on the subject, providing deeper insight
#    into the commit's purpose and implementation details.

# Footer
#  - Breaking Changes:  Describe any breaking changes introduced by this commit.
#     BREAKING CHANGE: [Description of the breaking change and its impact]
#
#  - Closes: #issue-number (Closes the specified issue on merge)
#  - Refs: #issue-number, https://example.com/docs (Links to related resources)
#  - **Reason:** The footer provides essential metadata, such as breaking change notices and references to related issues or documentation.

#  This template is designed to encourage well-formatted and informative commit
#  messages, based on best practices and conventional commits.  It aims to:
#
#  1.  **Improve Communication:** Make it easier for developers to understand
#      the history of the project and the reasoning behind changes.
#         - **Reason:** Clear and consistent commit messages facilitate
#           collaboration, debugging, and maintenance.
#  2.  **Standardize Commit History:** Ensure a consistent format for all commit
#      messages.
#         - **Reason:** A standardized history simplifies searching, filtering,
#           and generating release notes or changelogs.
#  3.  **Enable Automation:** Allow for automated tooling based on commit
#      messages (e.g., automatic versioning, release note generation).
#         - **Reason:** Consistent formatting enables tools to reliably parse
#           commit messages and perform automated actions.
#  4.  **Encourage Thoughtful Commits:** Prompt developers to think about the
#      purpose and impact of their changes.
#         - **Reason:** A well-considered commit message often reflects a
#           well-considered change.
