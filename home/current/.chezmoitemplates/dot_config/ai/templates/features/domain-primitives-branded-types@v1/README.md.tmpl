# Feature Pack: Domain Primitives — Branded Types (v1)

## What this provides
- TypeScript helpers for branded types to enforce domain constraints at compile time.
- Example: `UserId`, `OrderId`, `Email`, etc.

## Files
- `typescript/brand.ts.tmpl` — core branded type helper
- `typescript/index.ts.tmpl` — sample exports and example domain types

## How to use
1. Copy generated files into your TypeScript project.
2. Replace example types with your real domain types.
3. Ensure your linter/tsconfig are configured for strict mode.

## Testing
- Add unit tests to validate type-level behavior and coercion helpers.

## Notes
- Branded types improve safety without runtime overhead. Validate at boundaries.
