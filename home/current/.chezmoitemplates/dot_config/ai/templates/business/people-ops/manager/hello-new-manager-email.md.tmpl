Subject: Introduction — <your-name>, <your-role>

Hi <manager-name>,

I’m excited to join as <your-role> on <team> starting <start-date>. To make our ramp smooth, here’s a brief:

- Focus for the first 2 weeks: <bullets>
- Immediate decisions/dates where I’ll seek your input: <bullets>
- Proposed 1:1 cadence and format: weekly, 30–45 mins; agenda attached

I drafted a kickoff doc capturing expectations, stakeholders, and a 30/60/90 outline:
- Kickoff doc: <kickoff-doc>
- Weekly update format: <weekly-template>
- Monthly status format: <monthly-template>
- Calendar: <calendar>

Please let me know your preferences on cadence, channels, and decision visibility. Looking forward to partnering closely.

Thanks,
<your-name>
