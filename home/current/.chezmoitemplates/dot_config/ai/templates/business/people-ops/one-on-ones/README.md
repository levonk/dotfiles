# One-on-One Templates

This folder contains 1:1 templates organized by audience and cadence.

## Naming convention

- `1-1-<audience>-<cadence>.md.tmpl`
- Audiences: `clients`, `staff`, `leadership`, `peers`
- Cadences: `weekly`, `biweekly`, `monthly`

## Special Templates

- `1-1-casual-social.md.tmpl` - For relationship building and casual conversations (as-needed cadence)

## Examples

- `1-1-leadership-weekly.md.tmpl`
- `1-1-staff-weekly.md.tmpl`
- `1-1-peers-weekly.md.tmpl`
- `1-1-clients-weekly.md.tmpl`
- `1-1-casual-social.md.tmpl`

## Usage

- Duplicate and adjust cadence or audience as needed.
- Keep frontmatter consistent; prefer tags like `doc/people-ops/1-1` and `audience/<audience>`.
- Use the casual/social template for relationship building; complement with regular work-focused 1:1s.
