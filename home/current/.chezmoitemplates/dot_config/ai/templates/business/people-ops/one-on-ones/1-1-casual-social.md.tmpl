## How to Set Up

### Sample Invitations

**Email Template:**
```
Subject: Quick coffee chat?

Hi [Name],

I hope you're doing well! I've really enjoyed our interactions and was wondering if you'd be open to grabbing a quick coffee (or virtual coffee) sometime next week. I'd love to get to know you a bit better outside of our usual work discussions and hear more about what you're working on.

No agenda, just a casual chat to build our working relationship. I'm flexible on timing - let me know what works for you!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Slack/Message Template:**
```
Hey [Name]! ðŸ‘‹

I've really enjoyed working with you and was wondering if you'd be up for a casual 25-30 min chat sometime this week or next? No work agenda, just want to get to know you better and build our relationship.

Totally optional and low-pressure - happy to work around your schedule!
```

**In-Person Approach:**
```
"Hey [Name], I've really enjoyed our collaboration lately. Would you be open to grabbing coffee sometime this week? I'd love to chat more casually and get to know you better beyond work stuff."
