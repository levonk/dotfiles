# Status Patterns

Reusable snippet library to speed up weekly and monthly write-ups.

## Files

- `executive-summary-patterns.md.tmpl` — short, ready-to-paste exec summary patterns by audience.

## Usage

- Open the patterns file and copy a snippet that fits your audience and cadence.
- Tune the nouns and metrics; keep 3–5 bullets for an executive summary.
- Prefer evidence-focused phrasing and link to dashboards/docs.

## Conventions

- Keep bullets short; lead with impact; follow with supporting metric.
- Avoid team-internal jargon in exec summaries; reserve it for deeper sections.
- Use consistent order: Highlights → Metrics → Risks/Asks (if any).
