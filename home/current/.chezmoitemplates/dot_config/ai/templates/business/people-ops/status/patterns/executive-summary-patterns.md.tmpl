# Executive Summary Patterns (Copy/Paste)

> Use 3–5 bullets. Lead with impact; back it with a metric. Replace <> placeholders.

## Manager/Leadership — Delivery + Quality
- Shipped <feature/project> improving <business/user outcome> by <metric delta>.
- Reduced <lead time/cycle time> by <X%> via <process/tool change>.
- Quality held at <defect rate/escapes>; addressed <#> high-sev issues with MTTR <Xh>.
- Next: <priority> to advance <goal/OKR> by <date>.

## Manager/Leadership — Risk + Decision
- Risk: <concise risk>; impact <H/M/L>; mitigation in progress; ETA <date>.
- Decision needed: <what/why>; options A/B; recommend <pick> by <date>.
- Capacity: <change/constraint>; propose <hire/backfill/deferral>.

## All Audiences — Broad Update
- Delivered <thing> for <audience/user>; immediate outcome <metric or qualitative win>.
- On track for <milestone/date>; dependency with <team/person> confirmed.
- Heads-up: <lightly-sanitized risk or change>; no action needed now.

## Client — Value + Next Steps
- Delivered <value/outcome> on <workstream>; early signal: <metric/user feedback>.
- Upcoming: <milestone> on <date>; requires <approval/info> from <client contact>.
- Risks: <concise>; mitigation <plan>; ask <decision/info> by <date>.

## Metrics-forward (pick 2–3)
- Delivery: throughput <X/wk>, lead time <Xd> (Δ <+/-Y%> WoW/MoM).
- Reliability: availability <99.xx%>, <#> incidents (MTTR <Xh>).
- Quality: defect rate <X%>, escaped bugs <#>.

## Recognition (optional)
- Shout-out: <name/team> for <impact> on <project>.

## Links (optional)
- Dashboards: <links>
- Docs/PRDs: <links>
