Subject: Kicking off <account> — Internal alignment and next steps

Hi team,

We’re starting <account>. Here’s the quick plan and asks:

- Objective and initial scope: <1–2 bullets>
- Key dates/milestones: <bullets>
- Roles and responsibilities: see RACI
- Risks/assumptions to track: see RAID
- Cadence: standups, status, stakeholder syncs

Kickoff agenda:
- Goals and success criteria
- Scope and deliverables
- Timeline and dependencies
- Risks and mitigations (RAID ownership)
- ways of working and comms
- Next steps

Related templates:
- Client kickoff email: engagement-kickoff-client.md.tmpl
- Project kickoff: ../../projects/project-kickoff.md.tmpl
- RAID log: ../../projects/raid-log.md.tmpl
- RACI matrix: ../../projects/raci-matrix.md.tmpl

Thanks,
<your-name>
