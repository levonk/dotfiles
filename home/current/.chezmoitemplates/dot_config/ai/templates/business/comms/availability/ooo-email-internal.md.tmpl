Subject: OOO — <name> (<away-start>–<away-end> <timezone>)

Hi team,

I’m out of office from <away-start> to <away-end> (<timezone>). During this time my email and Slack will be <not monitored | checked periodically>.

For anything time-sensitive, please contact <primary delegate (name, Slack @handle, email)>. For escalations, reach <manager or team DL>.

I’ll follow up after I’m back on <return date>.

Thanks,
<name>
<role>, <team>
