# Project Templates

This folder contains templates for starting and running projects.

## Files

- `project-kickoff.md.tmpl` — structured agenda and artifacts for kickoff
- `raid-log.md.tmpl` — risks, assumptions, issues, dependencies
- `raci-matrix.md.tmpl` — accountability and communication clarity

## Conventions

- Keep frontmatter minimal but consistent; prefer tags like `doc/projects/kickoff` and `doc/projects/governance`.
