# Daily Status ‚Äî All (Agent)

## Goal

- Produce a concise daily update suitable for broad sharing; sanitize sensitive details.

## Inputs

- period_key: e.g., `2025-09-23`
- owner (optional)
- team (optional)
- output_path (optional; defaults under `reports/status/daily/all/`)

## Primary Workflow

1. Resolve template from `defaults.template`.
2. Read template; render placeholders (owner/team/period_key).
3. Sanitize risks and details; keep plain-language summaries.
4. Write output to `output_path` or `{output_dir}/status-daily-all-{period_key}.md`.
5. Return summary.
