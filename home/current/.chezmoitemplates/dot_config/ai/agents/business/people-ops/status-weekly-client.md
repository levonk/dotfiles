# Weekly Status â€” Client (Agent)

## Goal

- Produce a weekly client update focusing on outcomes, value, milestones, risks/issues, and decisions.

## Inputs

- period_key: e.g., `2025-09-15..2025-09-21`
- owner (optional)
- account (optional)
- output_path (optional; defaults under `reports/status/weekly/client/`)

## Primary Workflow

1. Resolve template from `defaults.template`.
2. Read template; render placeholders (owner/account/period_key).
3. Emphasize outcomes, milestones, and clear decisions/asks.
4. Write output to `output_path` or `{output_dir}/status-weekly-client-{period_key}.md`.
5. Return summary.
