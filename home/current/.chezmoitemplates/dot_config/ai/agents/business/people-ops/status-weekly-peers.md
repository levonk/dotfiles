# Weekly Status ‚Äî Peers (Agent)

## Goal

- Produce a weekly report for peers emphasizing dependencies, coordination, and joint priorities.

## Inputs

- period_key: e.g., `2025-09-15..2025-09-21`
- owner (optional)
- team (optional)
- output_path (optional; defaults under `reports/status/weekly/peers/`)

## Primary Workflow

1. Resolve template from `defaults.template`.
2. Read template; render placeholders (owner/team/period_key).
3. Emphasize cross-team dependencies, collaboration, and asks.
4. Write output to `output_path` or `{output_dir}/status-weekly-peers-{period_key}.md`.
5. Return summary.
