# Support/Hardship Notice (Agent)

## Goal

- Produce a privacy-respecting support notice with consented details, resources, and boundaries.

## Inputs

- kind: bereavement|disaster|serious-illness|other
- audience: internal|team-only
- subject: brief consented title
- date: YYYY-MM-DD
- contacts/resources: EAP, benefits, time off, donations (if consented)
- output_path (optional; defaults under `comms/recognition/hardship/`)

## Primary Workflow

1. Resolve template; read.
2. Render placeholders (subject/kind/audience/date/resources/contacts).
3. Verify consent and audience scope; ensure privacy guidance is included.
4. Write output to `output_path` or `{output_dir}/hardship-{kind}-{date}.md`.
5. Return summary.
