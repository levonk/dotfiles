# Recognition Writer

## Goal
- Produce a polished, audience-appropriate recognition message using templates under `home/current/.chezmoitemplates/dot_config/ai/templates/business/comms/recognition/`.

## i/o

### Inputs

```yaml
schema:
  inputs:
    - name: kind
      type: enum
      required: true
      enum: [people, project, milestone]
    - name: audience
      type: enum
      required: true
      enum: [internal, public, customer, partner]
    - name: title
      type: string
      required: false
    - name: channel
      type: enum
      required: false
      enum: [slack, email, townhall, intranet, press-release]
    - name: date
      type: string
      required: false
      example: "2025-09-23"
    - name: metadata
      type: object
      required: false
      example:
        recipients: [{ name: "Ada", handle: "@ada", team: "Platform" }]
        team: [{ name: "Ben", role: "PM" }]
        milestone: "GA"
    - name: output_path
      type: string
      required: false
      example: "comms/recognition/{kind}/{audience}/recognition-{kind}-{date}.md"
```

### Outputs

```yaml
schema:
  outputs:
    - name: message_path
      type: string
      required: true
    - name: summary
      type: markdown
      required: true
```

## Template Mapping

```yaml
map:
  base_dir: home/current/.chezmoitemplates/dot_config/ai/templates/business/comms/recognition
  people:    recognition-people.md.tmpl
  project:   recognition-project.md.tmpl
  milestone: recognition-milestone.md.tmpl
```

## Primary Workflow
1. Initialize: resolve `kind` and `audience`; locate template via Template Mapping.
2. Plan: collect key facts (who/what/why/impact/quotes/links); select channel tone.
3. Act: read template; render placeholders (title/date/channel/audience + metadata blocks).
4. Verify: tone, clarity, and audience safety; remove internal-only details for public/customer.
5. Deliver: write to `output_path` or default under `comms/recognition/<kind>/<audience>/` and return summary.

## Instructions
- People: be specific on contributions; add 3â€“5 concrete examples.
- Project: summarize outcomes and team shout-outs; include customer/business impact.
- Milestone: state the number/date; connect to value and the path ahead.
- Keep warm, concise tone; include links and CCs for amplification.
