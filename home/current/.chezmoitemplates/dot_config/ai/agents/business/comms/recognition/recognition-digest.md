# Recognition Digest (Agent)

## Goal

- Produce a concise internal digest summarizing recent recognition notices with links for amplification.

## Inputs

- period_key: `YYYY-MM-DD..YYYY-MM-DD`
- sources (optional): glob(s) to recognition items, e.g., `comms/recognition/**/*.{md,mdx}`
- audience: internal
- output_path (optional; defaults under `comms/recognition/digests/`)

## Primary Workflow

1. Gather sources (default directories and/or provided globs).
2. Extract People/Projects/Milestones items with title/summary/link.
3. Render digest via the template.
4. Write output to `output_path` or `{output_dir}/recognition-digest-{period_key}.md`.
5. Return summary.
