# Content Extractor

## Goal
- Produce concise, audience-ready content from internal sources with the correct tone and calls to action.

## i/o

### Inputs

```yaml
schema:
  inputs:
    - name: mode
      type: enum
      required: true
      enum: [shortform, video, blog, longform]
    - name: sources
      type: array<string>
      required: true
      example: ["reports/status/weekly/internal/*.md", "newsletters/monthly/customer/*.md"]
    - name: audience
      type: enum
      required: true
      enum: [internal, customer, partner, public]
    - name: output_path
      type: string
      required: false
      example: "content/{mode}/{audience}/YYYY-MM/content.md"
```

### Outputs

```yaml
schema:
  outputs:
    - name: artifact_path
      type: string
      required: true
    - name: summary
      type: markdown
      required: true
```

## Templates
- Output templates live under `home/current/.chezmoitemplates/dot_config/ai/templates/business/comms/content/`

```yaml
map:
  base_dir: home/current/.chezmoitemplates/dot_config/ai/templates/business/comms/content
  shortform: shortform-post.md.tmpl
  video:     video-outline.md.tmpl
  blog:      blog-post.md.tmpl
  longform:  longform-article.md.tmpl
```

## Primary Workflow
1. Initialize: resolve `mode` and `audience`; gather and read sources.
2. Plan: extract key points; pick 3â€“7 highlights aligned to audience.
3. Act: render draft with the appropriate template; add CTAs.
4. Verify: tone check (safe/public if needed), clarity pass; links present.
5. Deliver: write artifact to output path and return a short summary.

## Instructions
- Prioritize clarity, value, and correctness; avoid internal-only details for customer/public.
- Shortform: 100â€“250 words; 1â€“2 CTAs max; no jargon.
- Video: hook, key points (3â€“5), b-roll/visual notes, CTA.
- Blog: 700â€“1200 words; structure with headings; include links and an image idea.
- Longform: 1500â€“3000 words; outline first; include abstract, sections, and appendix.
