Feature: Shell Performance and Optimization
  As a user of the dotfiles system
  I want fast shell startup times
  So that my development workflow is not slowed down

  Background:
    Given the dotfiles system is installed
    And performance monitoring is enabled

  Scenario: Shell startup performance
    Given a new shell session is started
    When the shell configuration loads
    Then the total startup time should be under 500ms
    And no single configuration file should take more than 100ms
    And timing information should be available for debugging

  Scenario: Redundant sourcing prevention
    Given shell configuration files have sourcing guards
    When a file is sourced multiple times in one session
    Then the file should only execute its logic once
    And subsequent sourcing attempts should be skipped
    And a sourcing registry should track loaded modules

  Scenario: Lazy loading of optional modules
    Given optional shell modules are configured for lazy loading
    When a shell session starts
    Then only essential modules should be loaded immediately
    And optional modules should load on first use
    And the user should not notice any functionality missing

  Scenario: File sourcing optimization
    Given frequently sourced configuration files exist
    When shell configurations are loaded
    Then caching mechanisms should be used where appropriate
    And file modification times should be checked before re-sourcing
    And cached configurations should be invalidated when files change
