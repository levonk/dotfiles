# Requirements Directory

This directory contains BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) test specifications for the dotfiles repository.

## Structure

- `*.feature` files: Gherkin-format test specifications
- `steps/`: Step definitions for test automation
- `fixtures/`: Test data and configuration files

## Purpose

These requirements define the expected behavior of the dotfiles configuration system, including:

- Shell environment setup and sourcing
- XDG directory compliance
- Git configuration management
- Error handling and validation
- Performance characteristics

## Running Tests

Tests can be executed using tools like:
- `cucumber` for Ruby-based step definitions
- `behave` for Python-based step definitions
- `bats` for shell script testing

See the main README for specific test execution instructions.
