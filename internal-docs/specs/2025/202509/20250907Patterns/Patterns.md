 	- **Concept**: Applying transformations to data for security and privacy.
		- `minimize(data)`: To remove all but the essential fields.
		- `redact(data, fieldsToRedact)`: To replace sensitive values with a placeholder.
		- `tokenize(data, field)`: To replace a value with a token.
		- `hash(data)`: For one-way data scrambling.
		- `encrypt(data)`: For two-way data protection.
		- `mask(data, field)`: To partially hide a value (e.g., `***-**-1234`).
		- `compileTimeError`

			4. Current Clients: Upsell
			4. Acquire Clients
				a. Recurring Revenue
				a. Flat Revenue
			8. High EBITDA Tech Debt

			8. Tech Debt: Urgent & Not Important
			8. Tech Debt: Not Urgent & Not Important
		- Incident Handling
			1. Mitigation - Stop the bleed, reference playbooks, inform stakeholders, update public & private status dashboard
			1. Remediation - Short term workaround
			1. Analysis - Understand What happened
			1. Post Mortem - Tickets for short term, long term, report, present to stakeholders, communicate to users
			1. Fix Prioritization
			1. Short term fixes
			1. Long term fixes

## Architecture Patterns
Here‚Äôs a comprehensive catalog of foundational software development principles‚Äîstructured for clarity and reproducibility. These principles guide maintainability, modularity, and override-aware architecture across systems:

---

### üß† Core Design Principles

| Principle | Summary | Purpose |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) | Avoid code duplication | Reduces maintenance overhead and inconsistency |
| **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid) | Favor simplicity over cleverness | Enhances readability and reduces bugs |
| **YAGNI** (You Aren‚Äôt Gonna Need It) | Don‚Äôt build features until necessary | Prevents overengineering |
| **SOLID** | Five OOP principles for scalable design | Promotes modular, testable, and maintainable code |

---

### üîß SOLID Breakdown

| Principle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **S** - Single Responsibility | Each module/class should have one reason to change |
| **O** - Open/Closed | Software entities should be open for extension, closed for modification |
| **L** - Liskov Substitution | Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types |
| **I** - Interface Segregation | Prefer many specific interfaces over one general-purpose interface |
| **D** - Dependency Inversion | Depend on abstractions, not concretions |

---

### üîó Coupling & Cohesion

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Loosely Coupled** | Modules interact via well-defined interfaces, minimizing dependencies |
| **Avoid: Tightly Coupled** | Modules are interdependent, making changes risky and harder to isolate |
| **High Cohesion** | Related functionality is grouped together, improving clarity and reuse |

---

### üß© Architectural & Behavioral Principles

| Principle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Separation of Concerns** | Divide responsibilities across layers/modules |
| **Composition Over Inheritance** | Favor object composition to promote flexibility |
| **Law of Demeter** | ‚ÄúTalk only to your immediate friends‚Äù ‚Äî limit knowledge of other modules |
| **Fail Fast** | Detect and report errors early in execution |
| **Immutability** | Prefer immutable data structures to reduce side effects |
| **Convention Over Configuration** | Use sensible defaults to reduce setup complexity |

---

### üß™ Testability & Maintainability

| Principle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** | Write tests before implementation |
| **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** | Focus on expected behavior via human-readable specs |
| **Clean Code** | Prioritize readability, naming, and structure |
| **Refactor Often** | Continuously improve code without changing behavior |
